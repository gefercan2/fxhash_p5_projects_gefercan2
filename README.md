# Fxhash_projects
Projects done using FX Hash code. Each folder contain an html file as placeholder, a p5 library code as reference: https://p5js.org/ , a css code for basic styling and the sketch itself. 
Most of the sketches were developed in Open Processing, a site for online coding with the p5 library: https://openprocessing.org and the reference of the library: https://p5js.org/reference/
Some of the sketches do not use FX HAsh yet but are implemented using random. random() will be replaced by fx rand(). An example is the orange sketch.
Here also are other samples , mainly because they are built in p5.js

#Essential Resources
#### The Coding Train (YouTube): Daniel Shiffman is the "patron saint" of p5.js. His Code! Programming with p5.js playlist is gold.
#### p5.js Reference: Keep the Reference Page open at all times. It's the best documentation in the dev world.
#### OpenProcessing: Look at what others are making for inspiration (and to peek at their code).

Learning p5.js in a month is a fantastic goal. Because p5.js is designed for visual instant gratification, you’ll be making "art" on Day 1.
The best way to tackle this is to spend 30–60 minutes a day. Use the p5.js Web Editor so you don't have to worry about setup.
Week,Day,Topic,Goal
1,1,The Canvas,Understand setup() vs draw() and the coordinate system.
1,2,2D Shapes,"Draw primitives like rect(), ellipse(), and line()."
1,3,Color & Style,"Master fill(), stroke(), and RGB/Hex values."
1,4,Coordinates,Practice spatial placement and layering shapes.
1,5,Custom Shapes,Use beginShape() and vertex() for complex polygons.
1,6-7,Mini-Project,"Create a static ""Self-Portrait"" or ""Robot."""
2,8,Variables,Use let to store positions and sizes.
2,9,Mouse Variables,Create sketches that track mouseX and mouseY.
2,10,Basic Animation,Increment variables to create movement over time.
2,11,Randomness,Use random() for jitter and varied color palettes.
2,12,The map() Function,"Translate one range of numbers to another (e.g., mouse to color)."
2,13,Conditionals,"Use if/else statements for ""bouncing"" logic."
2,14,Mini-Project,Build an interactive drawing tool/paint program.
3,15,for Loops,Automate repetitive tasks and draw multiple objects.
3,16,Nested Loops,"Create grids, tiled patterns, and wallpapers."
3,17,Custom Functions,Clean up code by creating your own reusable functions.
3,18,Transformations,"Use translate(), rotate(), and push/pop."
3,19,Trigonometry,"Use sin() and cos() for oscillating, organic motion."
3,20,Arrays,Manage lists of data (like multiple circle positions).
3,21,Mini-Project,Build a generative grid-art generator.
4,22,OOP / Classes,"Create ""blueprints"" for objects with properties and behaviors."
4,23,Particle Systems,Use arrays to manage 50+ moving object instances.
4,24,Collisions,Write logic for when two objects intersect.
4,25,Media (Images),Load and display external .jpg or .png files.
4,26,Sound,Use the p5.sound library for audio interaction.
4,27-30,Final Project,"Develop a game, visualizer, or complex generative work."
