# Fxhash_projects
Projects done using FX Hash code. Each folder contain an html file as placeholder, a p5 library code as reference: https://p5js.org/ , a css code for basic styling and the sketch itself. 
Most of the sketches were developed in Open Processing, a site for online coding with the p5 library: https://openprocessing.org and the reference of the library: https://p5js.org/reference/
Some of the sketches do not use FX HAsh yet but are implemented using random. random() will be replaced by fx rand(). An example is the orange sketch.
Here also are other samples , mainly because they are built in p5.js

#Essential Resources
#### The Coding Train (YouTube): Daniel Shiffman is the "patron saint" of p5.js. His Code! Programming with p5.js playlist is gold.
#### p5.js Reference: Keep the Reference Page open at all times. It's the best documentation in the dev world.
#### OpenProcessing: Look at what others are making for inspiration (and to peek at their code).

Learning p5.js in a month is a fantastic goal. Because p5.js is designed for visual instant gratification, you’ll be making "art" on Day 1.
The best way to tackle this is to spend 30–60 minutes a day. Use the p5.js Web Editor so you don't have to worry about setup.

Here is the learning schedule organized into a scannable table.

| Week | Day | Topic | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Week 1** | 1 | The Canvas | Understand `setup()`, `draw()`, and the coordinate system. |
|  | 2 | 2D Shapes | Draw primitives like `rect()`, `ellipse()`, and `line()`. |
|  | 3 | Color & Style | Master `fill()`, `stroke()`, and color values. |
|  | 4 | Coordinates | Practice spatial placement and relative positioning. |
|  | 5 | Custom Shapes | Use `beginShape()` and `vertex()` for complex polygons. |
|  | 6-7 | **Project** | Create a "Self-Portrait" or "Robot" using static shapes. |
| **Week 2** | 8 | Variables | Create and use custom variables (`let`) for position/size. |
|  | 9 | Built-in Vars | Utilize interactive variables like `mouseX` and `mouseY`. |
|  | 10 | Animation | Increment variables inside `draw()` to create movement. |
|  | 11 | Randomness | Use `random()` for jitter and varied color palettes. |
|  | 12 | The `map()` Function | Translate one range of numbers into another for control. |
|  | 13 | Conditionals | Use `if/else` logic to create bouncing or edge detection. |
|  | 14 | **Project** | Build an interactive "Paint" program/drawing tool. |
| **Week 3** | 15 | For Loops | Use loops to draw multiple objects with minimal code. |
|  | 16 | Nested Loops | Create complex grids and repeating patterns. |
|  | 17 | Functions | Organize code into reusable custom functions. |
|  | 18 | Transformations | Master `translate()`, `rotate()`, and `push/pop`. |
|  | 19 | Trigonometry | Use `sin()` and `cos()` for wave-like motion. |
|  | 20 | Arrays | Store lists of data to manage multiple elements. |
|  | 21 | **Project** | Design a generative wallpaper/pattern generator. |
| **Week 4** | 22 | Classes (OOP) | Create "blueprints" for objects using Classes. |
|  | 23 | Object Arrays | Manage a collection of active objects (e.g., particles). |
|  | 24 | Collision | Write logic to detect when two objects intersect. |
|  | 25 | External Media | Import and display images using `loadImage()`. |
|  | 26 | Sound | Add audio triggers and effects using p5.sound. |
|  | 27-30 | **Final Project** | Build a game, music visualizer, or generative garden. |
