# Fxhash_projects
Projects done using FX Hash code. Each folder contain an html file as placeholder, a p5 library code as reference, a css code for basic styling and the sketch itself. Most of the sketches were developed in Open Processing, a site for online coding with the p5 library: https://openprocessing.org and the reference of the library: https://p5js.org/reference/

Some of the sketches do not use FX HAsh yet but are implemented using random. random() will be replaced by fx rand(). An example is the orange sketch.

Here also are other samples , mainly because they are built in p5.js
