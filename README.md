# Fxhash_projects
Projects done using FX Hash code. Each folder contain an html file as placeholder, a p5 library code as reference: https://p5js.org/ , a css code for basic styling and the sketch itself. 
Most of the sketches were developed in Open Processing, a site for online coding with the p5 library: https://openprocessing.org and the reference of the library: https://p5js.org/reference/
Some of the sketches do not use FX HAsh yet but are implemented using random. random() will be replaced by fx rand(). An example is the orange sketch.
Here also are other samples , mainly because they are built in p5.js



Learning p5.js in a month is a fantastic goal. Because p5.js is designed for visual instant gratification, you’ll be making "art" on Day 1.
The best way to tackle this is to spend 30–60 minutes a day. Use the p5.js Web Editor so you don't have to worry about setup.

# Week 1: Shapes and Space
## Goal: Get comfortable with the coordinate system and drawing static images.

## Day 1: The Canvas. Understand setup() vs draw(). Learn createCanvas() and background().
## Day 2: 2D Shapes. Draw rect(), ellipse(), line(), and triangle().
## Day 3: Color & Style. Explore fill(), stroke(), strokeWeight(), and RGB/Hex values.
## Day 4: The Coordinate System. Practice placing shapes relative to each other (the origin is the top-left corner!).
## Day 5: Custom Shapes. Use beginShape(), vertex(), and endShape().
## Day 6-7: Mini-Project: Create a "Self-Portrait" or a "Robot" using only basic shapes and colors.

# Week 2: Variables and Animation
## Goal: Make things move and react to you.

## Day 8: Variables. Use let to create variables for position (x, y) and size.
## Day 9: Built-in Variables. Experiment with mouseX and mouseY.
## Day 10: Basic Animation. Increment a variable (e.g., x = x + 1) inside draw() to move a shape.
## Day 11: The random() function. Create jittery movement or random color palettes.
## Day 12: The map() function. Learn to "re-map" values (e.g., use mouse position to control a color range).
## Day 13: Conditionals (if/else). Make a ball "bounce" when it hits the edge of the screen.
## Day 14: Mini-Project: Create an interactive drawing tool (a "Paint" program) where clicking changes colors.

## Week 3: Efficiency and Logic
Goal: Stop repeating yourself and start organizing.

# Day 15: Loops (for loops). Draw 100 circles with 3 lines of code.

# Day 16: Nested Loops. Create a grid or a patterned wallpaper.

# Day 17: Functions. Learn to wrap your drawing code into a custom function like drawTree(x, y).

# Day 18: Transformations. Master translate(), rotate(), and push()/pop().

# Day 19: Trigonometry. Use sin() and cos() for smooth, wave-like movement.

# Day 20: Arrays. Store multiple values to keep track of many objects at once.

# Day 21: Mini-Project: A generative pattern generator. Press a key to "re-roll" a random, beautiful grid.

## Week 4: Objects and Complexity
Goal: Think like a programmer.

Day 22: Object-Oriented Programming (Classes). Build a "template" for an object.

Day 23: Multiple Objects. Use an array to manage 50 "Bubble" or "Particle" objects.

Day 24: Collision Detection. Make objects react when they touch each other.

Day 25: Media. Learn loadImage() and image() to bring outside graphics into your sketch.

Day 26: Sound. Introduction to the p5.sound library (making noises on click).

Day 27-30: Final Project: Build something complete. Ideas:

A simple game (Snake or Pong).

An interactive "Music Visualizer."

A "Generative Art Garden" that grows as you move the mouse.

Essential Resources
The Coding Train (YouTube): Daniel Shiffman is the "patron saint" of p5.js. His Code! Programming with p5.js playlist is gold.

p5.js Reference: Keep the Reference Page open at all times. It's the best documentation in the dev world.

OpenProcessing: Look at what others are making for inspiration (and to peek at their code).
