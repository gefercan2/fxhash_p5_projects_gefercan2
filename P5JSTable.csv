
Week 1 ,Shapes and Space -Goal Get comfortable with the coordinate system and drawing static images.
Day 1, The Canvas. Understand setup() vs draw(). Learn createCanvas() and background().
Day 2, 2D Shapes. Draw rect()  ellipse()  line()  and triangle().
Day 3, Color & Style. Explore fill() stroke()  strokeWeight()  and RGB/Hex values.
Day 4, The Coordinate System. Practice placing shapes relative to each other (the origin is the top-left corner!).
Day 5, Custom Shapes  Use beginShape()  vertex()  and endShape().
Day 6-7, Mini-Project: Create a Self-Portrait or a Robot using only basic shapes and colors.

Week 2, Variables and Animation - Goal: Make things move and react to you.
Day 8, Variables. Use let to create variables for position (x, y) and size.
Day 9, Built-in Variables. Experiment with mouseX and mouseY.
Day 10, Basic Animation. Increment a variable (e.g.  x = x + 1) inside draw() to move a shape.
Day 11, The random() function. Create jittery movement or random color palettes.
Day 12, The map() function. Learn to re-map values (e.g. use mouse position to control a color range).
Day 13, Conditionals (if/else). Make a ball bounce when it hits the edge of the screen.
Day 14, Mini-Project: Create an interactive drawing tool (a Paint program) where clicking changes colors.

Week 3, Efficiency and Logic - Goal: Stop repeating yourself and start organizing.
Day 15, Loops (for loops). Draw 100 circles with 3 lines of code.
Day 16, Nested Loops. Create a grid or a patterned wallpaper.
Day 17, Functions. Learn to wrap your drawing code into a custom function like drawTree(x, y).
Day 18, Transformations. Master translate(), rotate() and push()/pop().
Day 19, Trigonometry. Use sin() and cos() for smooth  wave-like movement.
Day 20, Arrays. Store multiple values to keep track of many objects at once.
Day 21, Mini-Project: A generative pattern generator. Press a key to  re-roll  a random beautiful grid.

Week 4, Objects and Complexity-Goal: Think like a programmer.
Day 22, Object-Oriented Programming (Classes). Build a  template  for an object.
Day 23, Multiple Objects. Use an array to manage 50 Bubble or Particle objects.
Day 24, Collision Detection. Make objects react when they touch each other.
Day 25, Media. Learn loadImage() and image() to bring outside graphics into your sketch.
Day 26, Sound. Introduction to the p5.sound library (making noises on click).
Day 27-30, Final Project: Build something complete. Ideas > A simple game (Snake or Pong) - An interactive Music Visualizer. -A  Generative Art Garden  that grows as you move the mouse.
